This machine learning project is a the final exam i had this year (2025) in "intelligent systems" course.                                      

                                                               
The primary objective of this machine learning project is to predict whether it will rain based on various weather parameters.  
The project utilizes a Logistic Regression model for this classification task.


Main steps:
- Separating the features (Temperature, Humidity, Wind_Speed, Cloud_Cover, Pressure) from the target variable (Rain).
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing).
- Training a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
- Finally: it Evaluates the model's performance using: accuracy, precision, recall, classification report, and confusion matrix.
